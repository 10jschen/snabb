Usage: find-limit [OPTIONS] DEVICE PCAP-FILE

  -b BITRATE, --bitrate BITRATE
                             Test bitrates up to BITRATE bits/second.
                             Default: 10e9.
  -D DURATION, --duration DURATION
                             Linger on each step for DURATION seconds.
                             Default: 1.
  -p PRECISION, --precision PRECISION
                             Measure to PRECISION bits/second.
                             Default: 0.001e9.
  -r RETRY-COUNT, --retry-count RETRY-COUNT
                             If a step fails, retry it RETRY-COUNT times.
                             Default: 3.
  --cpu CPU
                             Bind to the given CPU.
  --exec EXEC
                             Run EXEC in a shell after every step to
                             determine if the step succeeded.  Otherwise
                             a successful step is one that receives as
                             many packets on its interface as it sends.
  -h, --help
                             Print usage information.

Apply load on DEVICE by replaying packets from PCAP-FILE, and attempt to
determine the highest bitrate at which a test passes.

Examples:
  find-limit 01:00.0 cap1.pcap
