       --bench-file, -b FILENAME
                            The file or path name to which benchmark data is
                            written.  A simple filename or relative pathname

When the -v option is used, packets on the network interfaces are counted and
recorded, and the corresponding incoming and outgoing packet rates are print
out to stdout, suitable for passing to a graphing program.

If bench-file is set, output is printed to a file instead of stdout.
